use a starter template, so I had to make a lot of design decisions. When I wrote
the bio section on the home page, initially I put a long heading there as a
one-sentence introduction. As I was gazing at the screen, I felt something was
wrong. It was too wordy. But after I took out a few words, I was not satisfied
with what was left.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
