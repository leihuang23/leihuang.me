&lt;p&gt;I recently rewrote my blog website from scratch in Gatsby. This time, I didnâ€™t
use a starter template, so I had to make a lot of design decisions. When I wrote
the bio section on the home page, initially I put a long heading there as a
one-sentence introduction. As I was gazing at the screen, I felt something was
wrong. It was too wordy. But after I took out a few words, I was not satisfied
with what was left.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  &lt;/svg&gt;
&lt;/a&gt; the other day. It was about parabolic curve animation in vanilla JS. I
wondered how RxJS can implement this. Below is the result of my
investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine we take a perspective from a slow-motion camera. What humans see as a
smooth animation is just an object that is put at different places at every
fragment of a time period. This can be expressed as a &amp;lsquo;stream&amp;rsquo; of object
position. The mechanism of an animation can be simplified by somehow mapping
every fragment of a time period to a position point in space. In practice, time
cannot be fragmented indefinitely, what we want is an approximation of an
&amp;ldquo;atomic time unit&amp;rdquo;. The browser has provided us a tool to achieve this, which is
the &lt;code&gt;requestAnimationFrame&lt;/code&gt; API.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
